# 100DaysToOffload

*Day 1: Why am I doing this?*
Just a very simple challenge to write every day for 100 days - the very simple outline of the challenge is at [https://100daystooffload.com/](https://100daystooffload.com/).

In my heart of hearts I suspect this will be another endeavour I start and run with for a few days. I've plenty of wreckage in my home and all over the Internet of started projects. But the fact it will probably peter out doesn't mean I shouldn't have a go.

The challenge also illustrates the reversal the Internet brought: for centuries the ability to have your writing published was scarce, and attention to published matter was plentiful. Getting into print was the challenge.

In the Internet age the converse is true: there are many, many channels to publish your work online, and the barrier to being published is negligible. The challenge instead is to have anyone pay attention to your writing at all.

My approach to 100DaysToOffload (or more likely TwoOrThreeDaysToCreateAnAbandonedCornerOfTheInternet) is just to put some random wibblings here. As I learn about [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) I'm sure I'll syndicate the content on social media. But that's not the primary purpose.
