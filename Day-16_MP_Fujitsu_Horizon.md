# A Letter to my MP
*"Day 16: Wrongdoing as well as failure."*

``Disclaimer: this post is written in a personal capacity representing my views.`

I emailed my MP. I email him from time to time, and he always replies unless I clearly write __no reply require*d__.

I wrote this email because the Horizon affair is an embarrassment to government as well as the Post Office and Fujitsu. I'm, sure it will be kicked down the road and end up as an item in a catalogue of government IT failures. But I want him to know that the wool has not been pulled over __my__ eyes: that individuals in both the Post Office and Fujitsu knowingly gave false report that resulted in convictions of innocent people.

Terrible, terrible failures with a faulty system being made live, and no independent reconciliation of transactions to verify they were true. A failure at the most basic level to ensure probity in a financial system.

Those who explicitly perjured themselves have already been referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions (and please use whatever influence you have to ensure these referrals result in prosecution), but there was more widespread wrongdoing in both the Post Office and in Fujitsu.
