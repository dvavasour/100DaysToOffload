# Coming up later in #100DaysToOffload
*"Day 20: Taking a lead from Television for goldfish."*

One of the more annoying things is watching television programmes that keep telling you what happened earlier and what's going to happen later. Often made to allow for advert breaks, it seems like the most lazy form of padding.

With this in mind, I though I'd share the notes I made for topics I might write about later in this series.

## _Who am I?_

One of the fates I fear, but must be ready for later in life, is dementia. I'm 58 now, so hope that *if* it arrives it won't be for decades. But a good carer will often ask of a dementia patient *"what is this person like"*, with an understanding of their pre-dementia life informing their day-to-day interactions.

Maybe, among other things, this #100DaysToOffload series will help in answering that questions.

## After the break

My sh*t list of topics falls into two sets: technical and non-technical. There are far fewer than 80, but it's a shelf I'll steadily draw from. Some may never get properly written up.

### Non Technical
- **Big Brother** - how we've unwittingly arrived at Orwell's distopia and consented to it. _"He loved Big Brother"_
- **NHS as the national religion** - I'd earmarked this as a topic before weekly prayers _(aka clap for carers)_ was instituted
- **Taiwan as a non-state** - the peculiarly wrong international status of Taiwan
- **The Church in China** - how the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association represents the biggest schism in today's Catholic church
- **Air Travel** - the peculiarly damaging yet privileged position of the aviation industry
- **Kodak and Fujifilm** - a tale of two companies whose biggest market disappeared and their different fates
- **Nothing to hide** - my own take on the great fallacy of our times
- **Social Media** - another angle on the advent of Big Brother via consent

### Technical
- **Power consumption** - how the greening of our power system is predominantly viewed from the supply side, and how demand side "greening" could be just as potent
- **OpenSCAD** - tales of constructive solid geometry
- **git or not-git [posted at Day 19]** - how applications and tools store your work
- **Engraving music with Lilypond** - why computed engraved sheet music is so much more beautiful that "music notation" software


## In it for the long haul

My posts so far have been far from daily, and are likely to stay so - Kev's revised terms of reference (100 posts within 365 days) are more likely to be met. It's a set of subjects that's all over the place, but that reflects the state of my mind and view and opinions and experiences.
